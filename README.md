# WeatherPrediction
A simple weather prediction project using ML models
# Project Overview
This project predicts future weather patterns based on historical weather data using a machine learning model. The primary focus is to forecast the maximum temperature for the next day using features derived from the date and previous weather records. This project is based on the "Predict The Weather with Machine Learning: Beginner Project" from YouTube and has been enhanced for daily predictions.

# Features
Predicts maximum temperature for the next day.
Utilizes time-based features such as the day of the year and month.
Implements autoregressive forecasting to leverage previous predictions.
Handles historical weather data with preprocessing and feature engineering.
# Technologies Used
Python: Primary programming language
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and prediction
